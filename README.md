# Decoder_Ring

This decoder ring is a fun project that has three different decoders: Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, and Substitution Cypher. Each decoder allows 
you to chose between encoding and decoding. The main use of this project is simply for a fun party game or escape room.

This project not only tested my ability to write challenging algorithms, it also challenged me in my ability to write tests using Mocha and Chai.
